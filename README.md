For PouchDB, add SQLlite plugin in Cordova:

`ionic plugin add cordova-plugin-sqlite-2`

TODO:

[X] split setup object and game object

[X] check if either player has won yet (reached target)

[] add score correction modal (use swiping in table?)

[X] count fouls to three, maybe warning?

[] split objects that are saved to PouchDB

[] add gamedata persistence to PouchDB

[] use Firebase instead of PouchDB

[] add jest for unit testing
